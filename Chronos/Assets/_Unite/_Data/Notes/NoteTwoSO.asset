  title: ChronoSparx Distortion Effect
  content: The activation of the ChronoSparx satellite, while essential for our work,
    has unleashed an unexpected set of side effects. Each time the satellite is triggered,
    the island's landscape undergoes a disconcerting transformation. The very ground
    we stand on shifts and distorts, leaving us in a constant state of uncertainty.
    We need to be mindful of these distortions as they present a significant challenge
    to our mission.
